## LearnToRead

LearnToRead is an application designed to help kids learn new words by leveraging their existing word knowledge. This approach is inspired by my sister's struggle in learning new words.

### How It Works

The application uses a unique method that identifies the words a child already knows and builds upon that foundation. By introducing new vocabulary in the context of familiar words, children are more likely to understand and retain new information. This method not only enhances their vocabulary but also boosts their confidence in reading and learning.

### Features

- **Personalized Learning:** The app tailors the learning experience based on the child's existing knowledge.
- **Interactive Exercises:** Engaging activities that make learning fun and effective.
- **Progress Tracking:** Monitor the child's progress and adjust the learning plan accordingly.

### Inspiration

This project was inspired by my sister's journey in learning new words. I observed that she struggled with traditional methods, which often overwhelmed her with too much new information at once. By using her existing vocabulary as a foundation, she was able to learn new words more effectively and enjoyably.

### Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (43.1%)**
- **Python (35.2%)**
- **HTML (14.1%)**
- **CSS (7.6%)**

We hope this application will be a valuable tool for children facing similar challenges and make the process of learning new words a joyful experience.
